# Cultures Calendar
Cultures Calendar allows you to stay connected with holidays of many different cultures around the world. Choose from a large set of countries, and in some cases, choose the type of holiday (religious, observance, national) and watch your calendar fill up with all your holidays of interest! Holidays are color-coded and some even have short descriptions. On the day of those holidays, you will get notifications so that you can learn about the importance of those days and wish all those a 'Happy ____!'.

The hope is that this app will help make the world a smaller place as we learn about other cultures and keep up with our own!
